## What the devil is this?

This is a browser for Geminispace! Claude 4 Sonnet was the primary dev on this project and I helped my boy with some debugging and guidance. In the future, I'll expand this vibe coded mess with some better style and functionality.

Currently, you can use it to browse Geminispace in a regular browser. It's not much but it's Claude's honest work.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
